# Linear model

## Multivariate Linear Regression

1. *Data Sets*

   Student dataset:The dataset has three features which are height, age, weight.Except it has 13 items.

   Alougth the dataset is a tiny dataset, it is enough for me to test the accuracy of  the alogrithm written by myself.

2. *Experimental Setup*

   win10

   epoch:100

   learn_rate:0.0005

   train size:6

5. *Quantitative Results*

   The result of the model predict in the test dataset.

6. *Further Discussion*

   How to choose the parameters of alogrithm is hard for me. In the experiment, the alogrithm often return  large parameters.  At first, I think there are some error in my alogrithm. but I realize it is because the choice of the initial paramters.

## Logistic Regression

1. *Data Sets*

   watermelon dataset: The dataset has two features which are density,sugar content.Except it has 18 items.

   Alougth the dataset is a tiny dataset, it is enough for me to test the accuracy of  the alogrithm written by myself.

2. *Experimental Setup*

   win10

   epoch:100

   train size:12

3. *Quantitative Results*

   There is the  result of the alorithm how to classify.

4. *Further Discussion*

   the dataset is more suitable for non-linear alogrithm.

3. *Quantitative Results*

   There is the result of alogrithm how to reflect a sample to the line.

4. *Further Discussion*

   The alogrithm doesn't classify the sample clearly.
